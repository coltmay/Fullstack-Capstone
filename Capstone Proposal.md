# Capstone Proposal

**Name:** Colten Mayberry

**Email Address:** colten_mayberry@pm.me

**Mentorâ€™s Name:** TBD  

**Capstone Repo on Github:** https://github.com/coltmay/Fullstack-Capstone

## Proposal
**Name of Project:**
Resinstance

**Brief Proposal:**    
An application that records and plans out resistance training instances.

<br>

## Application Overview
**Overview of Application:**
1. What problem does your application solve?

    This health application aims to be narrowly focused on two key concepts for health: calorie-management and resistance training for muscle development.

1. Who are the target users of this application? 

    The target users are those who wish to have a single app that allows them to track health progress in a single, convenient place.

1. What can a user do with this application? 

    Track health progress (i.e. how heavy they are lifting, how much they weigh), save favorite workouts, and count calories.

1. Why do you want to build this application?

    I've recently started getting back into shape, and having a single convenient application to track my progress in lieu of notepads and hastily scribbled notes on my phone would benefit me

**Features included in MVP Definition:**

Authentication via Firebase
Full CRUD for the following:   
* User-Specific Data
* Banked Workouts
* "Resintances" (days containing variety of information)
* All other things found in ERD...

<br>

**Features that are Stretch Goals:**
* Chart to track progress.
* Implement [an external exercise api](https://wger.de).
* And possibly a nutrition api?  Though that seems rather daunting.

<br>

**Things you want your mentor to check in on:**

General backend stuff, authentication, etc.
